# USP-JEWEL
Jet propagation (currently done using an unofficial modification of JEWEL) in realistic viscous hydrodynamics modeled using vUSPhydro

---

Disclaimers: 
- v-USPhydro coupled with JEWEL 2.4.0 is still under development. Please use `jewel220mod-usp.f` for now.
- Send an email to leonardo.barreto.campos@usp.br for compatible medium profiles. Files are large and we are developing an easier way to distribute them.
